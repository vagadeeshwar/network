UDP part has been implemented... but not working yet
wrong implementation suspected in the recv functions of both client_util.c & server_util.c where buffer is read character by character
those functions when called automatically assume data has been read and end given no client is connected yet instead of waiting for client to connect and send some data

CRC logic works for some inputs... and fails miserably for others...
